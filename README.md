📊 Retail Sales Data Visualization System

The Retail Sales Data Visualization System is a SQL-based analytics project designed to analyze, visualize, and interpret retail transaction data. Developed as part of the Advanced Data Visualization (CPSC-600-3) course at the University of Niagara Falls, Canada, it demonstrates end-to-end data analysis — from database design to insight generation — supporting informed decision-making in retail operations.

📂 Database Design

Structured relational database featuring 10 interconnected tables, including:

Customers

Products

Stores

Sales Transactions

Employees

Regions

Time Dimensions

Categories

Payments

Discounts

The schema enforces primary and foreign key constraints, referential integrity, and normalization principles (up to 3NF) to ensure data accuracy, consistency, and scalability for large datasets.
